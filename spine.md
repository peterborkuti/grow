Daily exercises for preventing spine hurts. It takes 15 minutes, which takes two parts: warming-up (5 minutes), exercises (10 minutes). Schedule:

----

ZalÃ¡n: Core musle excercises~/ hip opening

PÃ©ter: Special Spine exercises, with some easy strenghtening for advanced practisioners

//Place//: If the wether allows,Â on the balcony, otherwise in the Kitchen

******Exercises******

We focus on warming up and strenghtening the core muscles, which are essential to maintain a correct posture. Furthermore, since we sit all the day, the hip is generally collapsed, causing the muscles to unnecessarily contract.Â Thus we will perform some exercises that opens the hip to mitigate this.Â 

----

9:45 and 11:00Â (PÃ©ter B.: doing yoga regularly for 6 years and participated in a 20 hours Spine Trainer course)

//Place//: Kitchen/Balcony

== Exercises ==

See the attached pdf-s. I will select 7-10 from the possibilities. Nothing serious, you should know all of them from PE. At the first some weeks there will be no strengthening exercises, only bending, rotating and twisting (no flexing, so it wont hurt).

== We recommend to ==

~* Arrive in time, because without warming-up, exercises can cause harm

~* BringÂ comfortable clothes for ZalÃ¡n classes. For the others, no need special clothes, but bring a cushion.

~* With regular, heavyÂ painÂ in your back you are not allowed to join. Go to a doctor immediately, please

~* With 2-3 back-pains every week, you are very welcome. It will help.

~* Without back pain: come, and we try to prevent the backpain
