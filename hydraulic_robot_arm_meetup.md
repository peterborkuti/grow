Esetleg lehetne ledes filcfigura készítés mellette (mint Nimród Darth Vadere). Ha jön apuka~/anyuka~/két gyerek, de csak az egyik felüket érdekli a kéz készítés, a másik fele csinálhatná a világítós filcfigurát. Ha ez másik helyen lenne, elkerülhetnénk a zsúfoltságot.\\A csocsóasztal meg a ping-pong lehetne az erkélyen? Vagy a habzsi-dőzsi? Valahogy osszuk szét a tömeget. Hangzavarban nem lehet építeni.

Number of kits: 50\\Number of guest (one adult, one child): 30 pair. \\Number of desks: 7\\Pair's at desks: 5\\Number of seats: 60 + 10 for the hosts~/helpers\\**Helpers**: One for every desk (7). They should build the arm in advance. //We need the pre-built arms on the desks. //This is strictly a FAMILY programme. So the adults should take care of their children and do TOGETHER the arm kit. If an adult starts to watch his/her mobile phone, he/she should be warned by the helpers. The adults can not leave their children unattended! It is not our responsibility to take care of their children. Helper will help at the build for the adults giving some advice, not for building the arm instead of them. But be very helpful and courteous! Show the appropriate part on the model, describe traps , but avoid building. If you build and it will not work they will blame you. But they must have a working arm at the end, so it is very tricky.** Let's speak about it**!\\**Ushers**: 3. They will greet the guests, tell them some words about the event, show them the toilet, show them the place where to put bags, show them a desk  and give them the arm kit.\\**Hot Glue Gun Guard**: a person who sits at the hot-glue desk (maybe he~/she can be one of the ushers). We may not need the hot glue in the first hour.\\First Aid kit at hand! Spray against burning!\\At the second half of the meetup they will help at the taps to fill-in the syringes\\**Hosts**: we need hosts who can look after small kids or watch the guests when doing other activities (ping-pong, darts, etc). \\**Me** (Péter Borkuti): I will go back and forth between the desks and help if it needs. Because there could be any unprepared issue at any desk, I could not be in one place.

**Desks**: Try to place the appropriate number of seats at the desks. Is it enough room for 10 people to build something at one desk? Should we have more desks? Or bigger? Should we use two desks for one build place?\\\\**Preparators**:\\200 Syringes must be drilled. It is fast to drill one (some seconds) however there are 200. Volunteers? It can be done at the beginning of the meetup. The hot glue guard?

**Small bins** for the bolts and nuts. Maybe we should make some from pet bottles~/yoghurt pots~/etc and give it them at arriving. (Ushers)\\**Hot glue guns** at one desk which has no seats. It needs constant assistance (1 person here)\\There should be some **scissors, filers and clamps** at another desk. The hot glue guard should also watch these and may curve the wires. \\**Big containers of water** to fill in syringes\\Places where to sit~/laid on the ground (**cushions, polifoams, bean-bags**)

**Foods and Drinks**:\\Apple (50 pieces), Water in small bottles, sandwiches? Pizza?No choco,cola,  sweets, etc. Think of children who can not eat such a thing.

Documentation

**Documentation my hang on the wall. Mainly pictures with very short instructions and order-numbers.**

10 pair of people who are willing to assemble the arms. One of them assemble, the other take pictures and notes. See **Helpers**!\\2 people to make the documentation based on the testers

Ordering the part:. I should put numbers on the parts, but unfortunately I forget to do it.
